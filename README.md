# Cooler-System
This is a Cooler system running on atmega 32 where the motor is turned on once the temprature is over 35 and there is a buzzer that confirms on temprature.
There is also 2 seven segment and LCD that represents the temprature on it to ensure about the correct temprature.
Here there is a picture of proteus file for the project.

Details:
1. Cooler, buzzer and LED will be on when temperature is more than 35C and off when less than 35C. 
2. Temperature should be appeared on LCD first row and also in seven-seg.
3. Cooler speed (duty cycle) should be appeared in second row.
4. Cooler system is consists of 5volt DC motor, when the range of temperature is from 35c to 50c the cooler Dc volt should be from 2.5 to 5 volt.

*Note:
The callibration of the temprature may vary from one person to another so make sure that its callibration is correct!*
